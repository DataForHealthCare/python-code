## projects

### Python Showcase Presentation - Polars Library

- **Description:** As part of HealthPartners Data Informatics learning initiatives I presented to internal stakeholders the Python Polars library for data engineering and analysis.

- **Goal:** Demonstrate a performance testing evaluation and comparison of the Polars and Pandas libraries.

- **Tools:** A Jupyter notebook with Python code and performance criteria.

### DevDays Event Presentation - Machine Learning

- **Description:** A group project focused on analyzing patient feedback from orthopedic knee surgeries.

- **Goal:** Use machine learning (sentiment analysis, linear regression) to turn text into insightful data and build classification models from the collected responses.

- **Tools:** Object-Oriented Python, scikit-learn, spacy, vaderSentiment, SQL, Pandas, Jupyter notebooks

- **File(s):** patient_outcomes_orthopedic_surgeries.ipynb

### Python Showcase - Machine Learning, Databricks

- **Description:** A presentation focused on Machine Learning and its ability to obtain actionable insights from healthcare data and predict cost.

- **Goal:** Demonstrate how to translate a Jupyter notebook project to a Databricks workflow.

- **Tools:** Jupyter notebooks, Panadas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, PySpark (ml, sql), SQL

- **Presentation Slides:** cost_prediction_model.pdf (Must download to view.)

- **File(s):** cost_prediction_model (Folder)

### PowerBI Reporting & Automation

- **Description:** An automated data analysis pipeline and performance monitoring dashboard (PowerBI) built to track the progress of weekly ETL pipelines.

- **Goal:** Utilize Python to calculate the performance times of data pipelines, build a monitoring database in Oracle, create a PowerBI dashboard for internal-stakeholders and automate the process with the AutoSys platform.

- **Tools:** Python, SQL, Oracle, PowerBI

- **File(s):** power_bi_cdw_processing (Folder)

### Unit Testing Presentation

- **Description:** A presentation demonstrating the concepts of unit testing including: best practices, use cases, benefits and takeaways.

- **Goal:** To educate a team of data analysts and engineers on how to unit test Python code for module development within the Databricks platform.

- **Tools:** Jupyter notebook, Python, ipytest

- **File(s):** unit_testing_presentation (Folder)

### Databricks Shared Module - Python

- **Description:** A Python module for automatically creating a row of default values for a dataframe.

- **Goal:** Create a importable Python module that allows the Databricks engineer to efficiently add a row of default values to any dataframe.

- **Tools:** Python, PySpark, pytest

- **File(s):** utilities\_/default_values_row (Folder)

### Batch Tracking Module - Python

- **Description:** An object-oriented module developed to track data processing performance within a Python program.

- **Goal:** Create a module with the ability to place objects around data processing events within a program and automatically capture the performance information within Oracle database tables.

- **Tools:** Python, cx_oracle

- **File(s):** utilities\_/batch_tracking_class.py

### Databricks ORM - Data Objects

- **Description:** An example of object relational mapping within the Databricks environment used for medical claims tables.

- **Goal:** Represent on-premise healthcare database tables with the Databricks platform.

- **Tools:** Python, PySpark, data classes, Jupyter notebook

- **File(s):** databricks_notebook_medical_claim_model.ipynb
